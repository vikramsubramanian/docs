Helm uses a packaging format called charts. A chart is a collection of files that describe a related set of Kubernetes resources. Talk to us to get a custom-made chart to install Mayil (with configuration details unique to your installation).


## Prerequisites

1. [Install Helm CLI](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
2. Create a Kubernetes cluster and set Kubectl to that cluster
3. A subdomain to host Mayil
3. Receive a custom Helm chart from us




## Setup HTTPS ingress

We will use cert-manager- [github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager)


Add the Jetstack chart -

```
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
```

Setup cert-manager -

```
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.13.3/cert-manager.crds.yaml
```



```
helm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager --namespace default --version v1.13.3
```

## Configuring Helm

You should have received a zip file from us containing a `.tgz` file. This is the helm chart. And a `values.yaml` with configuration options for Helm. Update these values-

1. `ingress.hosts.host`- The subdomain where Mayil will be hosted such as `mayil.companyname.com`
2. `envVars.LINK_TO_MAYIL` - The same subdomain as in `ingress.hosts.host`
3.  `certManager.email`- The email through which HTTPS certificates will be issued. No account set up or configuration is required. This is simply for record keeping by the certificate issuer.

`values.yaml` contains sensitive information. Please keep it safe. Save `envVars.CLIENT_ID` and `envVars.CLIENT_SECRET` as this will be the default username and password for Vault (used to configure Mayil)


## Installing Milvus

```
helm install mayil <path to helm chart> -f values.yaml
```

The helm chart should be in the installation package you receive as a `.tgz` file.

## Check cluster status

Investigate all the pods are running with-

```
kubectl get pods
```

A successful install should look like this-

```
kubectl get pods

NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS        AGE

mayilserver-app-878dc876f-47ch9            1/1     Running   0               4d20h
node-services-9c75474d9-8zb2r              1/1     Running   0               4d20h
```


Investigate ingress with-

```
kubectl get ingress
```

A successfull intall should look like this-

```
kubectl get ingress

NAME            CLASS   HOSTS           ADDRESS          PORTS     AGE
mayil-ingress   nginx   aug5.mayil.ai   172.214.14.253   80, 443   4d20h
```

The IP adress under `ADDRESS` is the IP address Mayil is connected to. We will link this IP to our subdomain in the next step


## Connect subdomain

Setup a DNS A record with your domain provider such as the example below using the information from runnning `kubectl get ingress` from the previous step-

```
Host name - aug5.mayil.ai
Value - 172.214.14.253
TTL - 30 Minutes
```
