## Installing Mayil's Jira integration

*Estimated setup time: 20 minutes*

Mayil's Jira integration consists of a OAuth 2.0 app and a webhook. The general instructions to install a Jira OAuth 2.0 is outlined [here](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/oauth-2-3lo-apps/). Information on how to set up a webhook is outlined [here](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/webhooks/#registering-a-webhook-via-the-jira-administration-console)


## Prerequisites

1. Admin access tp Jira
2. Enable OAuth 2.0 in the [developer console](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/oauth-2-3lo-apps/#:~:text=app%20using%20the-,developer%20console,-.)


## Setting up a OAuth 2.0 integration

1. From any page on developer.atlassian.com, select your profile icon in the top-right corner, and from the dropdown, select My apps.
2. Select create ➤ OAuth 2.0 integration. You should see something like this-

5. You will now be prompted to enter a callback url. Enter `<deploment>/api/callback/jira/` where deployment is where Mayil's backend API was deployed (An example would be `https://mayil.companyname/api/callback/jira/`)

6. Add API authorizations by clicking this button-

## Configuring Mayil's backend API

Various details generated during the setup process will need to be copied and provided to Mayil's backend API as configuation details. Update this JSON block with all the procured information-

```
{
    "integration_type": "jira",
    "identifier": "",
    "ignore_labels": [ ],
    "project": "My Kanban Project",
    "secret": "",
    "url": "",
    "webhook_secret": ""
}
```


1. Go to Settings for your new created OAuth app and copy `Client ID` into `identifier`  and copy `secret` into `secret`.
2. Identify the URL in which Jira runs and save that under url (e.g `https://mayiltest.atlassian.net`)

3. Identify the project name and save it under `Project`. In the example below, it is "My Kanban Project"

4. Mayil can be configured to not run on a ticket if certain tags are present on that ticket. List the names of those tags under `ignore_labels`. These tags can be called anything.

5. `webhook_secret` will be updated in the section below. After completing that, add this config block to `INTEGRATIONS` as outlined in the [Configuration](./configuration) page.

6. Now go to `<deploment>/api/health` and click on the Jira icon. Follow the instructions there to validate the OAuth app. Once completed, you should see this page-

6. Set a secret and update `webhook_secret` in the configuation details from the previous step

7. Add these Events-
