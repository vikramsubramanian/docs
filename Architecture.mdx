Mayil is designed to run in 2 phases:

 1. **Offline Indexing**- One time data ingestion step
 2. **Online Inference**- Real time inference that runs day-to-day to help developers


## Offline Indexing

A project's codebase from a git provider and documentation from various sources are ingested into Mayil's knowledge index.

This is a one time step that is done before the system is deployed and can take anywhere from 20 minuits to 2 hours.

Custom data ingestion interfaces can be easily built for company specific data sources such as custom wikis, databases, etc.

## Online Inference

Once the knowledge index is built, Mayil is ready to run.
